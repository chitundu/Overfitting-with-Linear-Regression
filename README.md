# Overfitting-with-Linear-Regression
Overfitting is a common problem in machine learning where a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise or random fluctuations in the data rather than the underlying patterns or relationships. This phenomenon occurs when the model becomes overly complex, effectively memorizing the training examples instead of generalizing to new, unseen data.
# Synthetic data
Synthetic data in machine learning refers to artificially generated data that mimics real-world data but is not derived from actual observations. It's commonly used when real data is insufficient, unavailable, or sensitive. Understanding synthetic data involves grasping its creation methods, applications, advantages, and limitations.

# Creation Methods:

Simulation: Data is generated using mathematical models or simulations that closely mimic real-world processes. For instance, simulating traffic patterns for autonomous vehicle testing.
Transformation: Real data is transformed to create synthetic samples by applying various statistical methods such as perturbing feature values, adding noise, or augmenting with additional attributes.
Generative Models: Advanced techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), or other deep learning models are used to learn and generate new data samples that resemble the original data distribution.
Normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a key concept in machine learning and statistics. It describes the probability distribution of a continuous random variable where the data clusters around a central mean value with a characteristic bell-shaped curve. Understanding normal distribution is crucial in various aspects of machine learning, including data analysis, modeling, and algorithm design.

# Key Characteristics of Normal Distribution:

Symmetry: The normal distribution is symmetric around its mean, with half of the data points falling to the left and half to the right of the mean.
Bell-shaped Curve: When plotted on a graph, the normal distribution forms a bell-shaped curve, with the highest point at the mean.
Central Tendency: The mean of the normal distribution represents its central tendency or average value. It is also the peak of the bell-shaped curve.
Standard Deviation: The spread or dispersion of the data around the mean is determined by the standard deviation. A larger standard deviation indicates greater variability in the data.
Uniform distribution is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics, often encountered in machine learning applications. It describes a scenario where all outcomes within a given range are equally likely to occur. Understanding uniform distribution in machine learning is essential for various tasks such as random sampling, generating synthetic data, and designing algorithms.

# Key Characteristics of Uniform Distribution:

Equal Probability: In a uniform distribution, all values within a specified interval have the same probability of occurring.
Constant Probability Density: The probability density function (PDF) of a uniform distribution is constant within the interval and zero outside the interval.
Flat Shape: When plotted on a graph, the probability distribution of a uniform distribution appears flat, indicating that each outcome is equally probable.
# Instances : 
Are data points that you feed into a machine learning model to learn from. For example, if you're teaching a computer to recognize cats, each picture of a cat would be an instance. The more diverse and representative instances you have, the better the model can learn and generalize to new, unseen examples.
